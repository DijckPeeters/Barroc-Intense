# Project structure
- Organize files into clear and logical subfolders (e.g., Models, Views, ViewModels, Services, etc.).
- Keep related files grouped together to maintain clarity and consistency.

# General Guidelines
- All code must be written in English.
- All commit messages must also be written in English or Dutch.

# Naming Conventions
- Use camelCase for variables and method names.
Example: userName, calculateScore()
- Use PascalCase for class names, file names, and public properties.
Example: LoginView, UserModel, IsLoggedIn

# Corporate Identity
- Primary colors: Yellow, Black, and White.
- Use these consistently across UI elements for a unified look.

# Code styling
- For comments, stick with comments such as: // ===================== Login (for example) ===================== in enhlish or dutch.
- If needed, add a description to the lines of code. Example: // Validates user input before saving
- Keep comments concise, clear, and relevant.
